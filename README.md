# DeepLearningVideoObjectTracking
MOT16 pedestrian tracking with Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8 + BoT-SORT, focusing on single-person ID persistence under occlusion.

This repository contains my CS5567 deep learning project: pedestrian tracking on the MOT16 dataset using a Faster R-CNN baseline and a YOLOv8 + BoT-SORT pipeline, including a single-person (ID 15) occlusion-robust tracking demo and the accompanying project slides.
